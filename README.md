#R.E.L.   Remote Entertainment Lifestyle UI


This prototype was built as part of a term project for 67-371: Fundamentals of System Development. As part of a task to design an 'internet-of-things' innovation, we created REL - a smart system that merges home theatre, television, and mobile technologies. REL was designed to allow access across all devices, so that users can view and adjust the preferences content on-the-go. Ideally, REL would be able to learn users' preferences over time, allowing for a comprehensive, intelligent home entertainment experience.

#The Prototype

This is a basic HTML prototype of how the REL interface might look. Using purely frontend tools, I designed a simple interface that walks through how one might browse shows, receive smart recommendations, and then adjust preferences. The UI is desktop. tablet, and mobile friendly.

Because of the limited scope of the prototype, functionality is limited, and not all areas may work as expected.
